# Online Hacking Day logs
This repository contains a dataset captured in 2020 during the Online Hacking Day, where computer science undergraduate or graduate students played CTF games invented by their colleagues within a specialized cybersecurity course. The dataset includes three trainees who played the same game. Data were preprocessed so that they can be used for a process mining analysis. This dataset consists of three CSV files.
## Raw_data.csv
Gathered data that can be further preprocessed for a specific process mining analysis.
## Detailed_behavior.csv
Data for the detailed process mining analysis, containing game events and the command history.
## Game_comments.csv
